Disk utilities:
du (abbreviated from disk usage) is a standard Unixprogram used to estimate file space usage—
space used under a particular directory or files on a file system.
du takes a single argument, specifying a pathname for du to work; if it is not specified, the current 
directory is used. The SUS mandates for du the following options:
-a, display an entry for each file (and not directory) contained in the current directory
-H, calculate disk usage for link references specified on the command line
-k, show sizes as multiples of 1024 bytes, not 512-byte
-L, calculate disk usage for link references anywhere
-s, report only the sum of the usage in the current directory, not for each file
-x, only traverse files and directories on the device on which the pathname argument is 
specified.
Other Unix and Unix-like operating systems may add extra options. For example, BSD and GNU 
du specify a -h option, displaying disk usage in a format easier to read by the user, adding units 
with the appropriate SI prefix’
$ du-sk*
152304 directoryOne
1856548 directoryTwo
Sum of directories in human-readable format (Byte, Kilobyte, Megabyte, Gigabyte, Terabyte and 
Petabyte):

149M directoryOne
1.8G directoryTwo
disk usage of all subdirectories and files including hidden files within the current directory (sorted 
by filesize) :

du shows how much space one ore more files or directories is using.
$ du -sh
103M
-s option summarize the space a directory is using and -h option provides "Human-readable" 
output.
Networking commands:
These are most useful commands in my list while working on Linux server , this enables you to 
quickly troubleshoot connection issues e.g. whether other system is connected or not , whether 
other host is responding or not and while working for FIX connectivity for advanced trading 
system this tools saves quite a lot of time .
• finding host/domain name and IP address - hostname
• test network connection – ping
• getting network configuration – ifconfig
• Network connections, routing tables, interface statistics – netstat
• query DNS lookup name – nslookup
• communicate with other hostname – telnet
• outing steps that packets take to get to network host – traceroute
• view user information – finger
• checking status of destination host - telnet
Example of Networking commands in Unix
let's see some example of various networking command in Unix and Linux. Some of them are 
quite basic e.g. ping and telnet and some are more powerful e.g. nslookup and netstat. When you 
used these commands in combination of find and grep you can get anything you are looking for
e.g. hostname, connection end points, connection status etc.
hostname
hostnamewith no options displays the machines host name
hostname –ddisplays the domain name the machine belong
